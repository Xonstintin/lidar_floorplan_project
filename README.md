# Floor Plan Generation from Point Cloud Data

## Overview
This project processes LiDAR point cloud data of a building and automatically generates a 2D floor plan. It consists of several steps: loading, preprocessing, projection, wall and door detection, and final DXF export. The approach prioritizes automation and generalizability over manual tuning or post-processing.

---

## Features
- LAS/LAZ point cloud loading using `laspy`
- Noise reduction with statistical filters
- PCA-based alignment
- Height slicing to extract architectural layers
- Contour and wall detection using Canny + Hough Transform
- Door detection via short-segment detection
- Export to DXF format (AutoCAD-compatible)

---

## Project Structure
- `preprocess.py` â€” loads and filters the original point cloud, applies alignment and height-based cropping.
- `extract_2d.py` â€” extracts and optionally saves a horizontal 2D slice.
- `load_and_visualize.py` â€” basic LAS loader and Open3D visualizer.
- `detect_features.py` â€” detects architectural features such as walls.
- `detect_doors.py` â€” attempts to find short gaps (doors/windows) using line detection.
- `export_dxf.py` â€” extracts contours from final floor plan and saves them to a DXF file.
- `config.py` â€” centralized file and directory path definitions.

## Approach & Challenges (written by the author)

> I approached this task with the concept of full automation and minimal manual tuning. However, tuning filtering parameters proved to be non-trivial due to the sheer volume and variety of points in the dataset.

> For example, I had to discard an external wall because statistically, it was indistinguishable in density or geometry from the internal building structure.

> I found that slicing the cloud closer to the ceiling produces cleaner contours but loses door data. Slicing lower keeps the doors but significantly increases noise. I chose not to manually clean these for consistency with my automation-first philosophy.

> Initially I suspected distorted building angles were due to slicing plane errors, but later realized that in Prague, 90Â° angles are far from guaranteed.

>Furniture and small objects can be removed by slicing closer to the ceiling or clustering for high-density structures.

### Thoughts
- Much of the noise could potentially be eliminated by restricting the sensor angle (e.g., clipping to 180Â°, shooting only inward), or by AI-driven classification of windows and ignoring points beyond them.
- A more advanced approach could include probabilistic modeling or strict contour extraction and point filtering *within* those boundaries.

### AI Ideas
I found a recent and very interesting model that does exactly this kind of structured layout extraction. It was released just days ago, so I didnâ€™t have time to implement it â€” but I believe it may be of great interest to you:
